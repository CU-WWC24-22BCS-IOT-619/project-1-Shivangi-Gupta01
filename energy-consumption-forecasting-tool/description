Energy Consumption Forecasting Tool is a web application designed to predict future energy consumption patterns using historical data and machine learning algorithms.
The tool provides users with predictive analytics, a user-friendly dashboard, customizable alerts, and detailed reporting to help manage and plan energy usage 
effectively.

The project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for the web interface and Python for implementing the machine learning model.

Key Features:
Historical Data Visualization: Display past energy consumption records.
Predictive Analytics: Forecast energy usage for selected dates.
Interactive Dashboard: User-friendly interface for input and results.
Scalable Backend: Supports integration with advanced ML models.
Customizable Alerts: Generate alerts based on usage trends.
